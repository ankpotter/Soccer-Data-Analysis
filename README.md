# Soccer-Data-Analysis

The analysis was done on Soccer data available on kaggle. Also some of the transfer data was exracted from Soccer News(http://www.soccernews.com/). We did analysis on transfer trends among a league and among all the leagues. Also, tried to cluster layers according to the postion they played in. There was no labelled data to test the results against and so we just looked through the players and checked accuracy based on domain knowledge.  

Most of the work was done on DB SQlite Browser as the data was in slite format. Results of what was on python can be seen from svg file.
The SVG files are the tranfer data results. WEKA was used for clustering of players, in order to identify which osition they play in.
The full report is in the file named 'Soccer Data Analysis.pdf'.
